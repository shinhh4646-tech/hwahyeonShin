## 2. Brief Description of Solutions

## Exercise 1
This project implements a SocialGraph class using two concurrent data structures to model social network dynamics:

Dual-Storage System: The class maintains an Adjacency Matrix (2D Array) for O(1) connectivity checks and an Adjacency List (Array of Lists) for memory-efficient storage.

Optimized Operations: Friendship updates (Add/Remove) are synchronized across both structures, ensuring data integrity while allowing for direct performance comparison.

Analytical Metrics: It calculates network Density and Completeness using global counters, and generates a Degree Distribution map to analyze user connectivity patterns.

Representation Fluidity: Built-in conversion functions (matrix_to_list, list_to_matrix) allow the graph to adapt its structure based on specific use cases or memory constraints.

Conclusion: The solution demonstrates that while matrices are faster for updates, the adjacency list is the only scalable choice for massive, sparse social networks.

## 3. Complexity Analysis Questions

## Exercise 1

1. Adjacency Matrix offers superior O(1) speed for connectivity checks and updates, while Adjacency List performs at O(d).

2. For 1 billion users, the Matrix is practically impossible (4 Exabytes), whereas the List is highly efficient (604 GB).

3. Use Matrix for high-frequency updates in small graphs, and List for scalability in massive social networks.
